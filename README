The program is a MonteCarlo Simulation program to calculate the lead time of polar seesaw. 

The program is adapted from a MATLAB version, and downloaded from nature.com.

Notice: Some programs are downloaded from network, such as fitting.f90 and interp_linear.f90, and modified by Qun Liu. Thanks for the authors of the open source programs.

Usage:
1. make
2. nohup make run &> MC_result &

The results will be writen to the file t_MC.dat and t_MCc.dat for warm and cool event.
